This repository showcases a collection of exercises, a final project, and a report focused on image processing techniques implemented using MATLAB. The exercises provide a hands-on learning experience, while the final project demonstrates a comprehensive application of various image processing algorithms.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Exercises**: This folder contains a series of exercises that cover different image processing techniques using MATLAB.

- **Final Project**: The final project folder includes the MATLAB code for an advanced image processing project. The project applies zonal masking, noise reduction, and histogram equalization techniques to transform input images. It showcases the practical application of image processing algorithms.

- **Report**: The report folder contains a detailed documentation of the final project. It includes a video curriculum that presents the project as a real-world scenario, along with project management tools such as a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt chart, and risk analysis.
